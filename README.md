# publicdataprojects 

## Purpose

This is the readme for this repository.

The repository is for all the projects I do with publicly available data with the express purpose of learning how to code better with R, and write and publish the results with Quarto.

I haven't quite figured out if i only want to use the Quarto blog publishing to make the code public or both that and github.
