## About this blog

CAKE

I have studied the use of antidiabetic drugs, or their utilisation, in Denmark, as part of my Ph.D. The main sources I worked with during the Ph.D. were registry data from [The Register of Pharmaceutical Sales](https://english.sundhedsdatastyrelsen.dk/health-data-and-registers/national-health-registers#) and [The National Patient Register](https://english.sundhedsdatastyrelsen.dk/health-data-and-registers/national-health-registers#).

This blog is dedicated to showcasing my skills as a data scientist with an understanding of health economics, epidemiology and medicine.

Using words inspired by the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/whole-game), I will do the following:

1.  Import datasets from different sources
2.  Transforming/wrangling data
3.  Visualise the data
4.  Make basic statistical models
5.  Interpret and communicate the results

Hopefully, and perhaps most importantly, perform these things with scientific rigour and examining hypothesis and assumptions underlying the data

All of this using the lovely tool made available by the Quarto toolbox funded by [Posit](https://quarto.org/about.html). I do this because I am thoroughly interested in data analysis and interpretation, and because I love playing detective and figuring stuff out.
