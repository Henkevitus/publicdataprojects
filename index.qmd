## Summary of wepbage

Welcome to my webpage. This can be considered by portfolio and playground. After a family-centered hiatus from working, I am picking up the torch again.

My journey from studying at university, to finishing a PhD, has lead me here. The combination of R/Quarto/Github is a wonderfully easy and customisable thing to test my skills and learn more.

**My one goal right now is figuring out how I can coalesce all my skills for the benefit of the Danish healthcare system and patients.**

## Who am I

I'm a:

- Husband and father
- Data lover
- People helper
- Learner
- Explorer of connections and correlations
- Tester of theories versus the real world
- Deep thinker and systematiser
- Pragmatic solution enthusiast

## AI

I am also an early adopter of AI - and a firm believer that it is:

- one of the most useful tools humanity has invented, hailed as "the great equalizer"
- overused, overblown, and potentially limiting human thinking and flourishing

As such, I will explicitly state when I use AI. Transparency, and being explicit in your assumptions and intentions is something i value highly.

As such, you have my word - as much as it is worth - that what is produced here is my own.

I ofcourse employ the use of AI - less than I should, for learning and correction.

But not for generating quick bites of beautifully cohorent but frustratingly nonsensical AI text or code.
