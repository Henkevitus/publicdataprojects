## Summary of wepbage

Welcome to my webpage.

This can be considered by portfolio and playground. The combination of R/Quarto/Github is a wonderfully easy and customisable thing.

My journey from studying at university has lead me here.

After a family-centered hiatus from working, I am picking up the torch again.

My one goal right now is figuring out how I can coalesce all my skills for the benefit of the Danish healthcare system and patients.

## Who am I

I'm a:

- Husband and father
- Data lover
- People helper
- Learner
- Explorer of connections and correlations
- Tester of theories versus the real world
- Deep thinker and systematiser
- Pragmatic solution enthusiast

## AI

I am also an early adopter of AI - and a firm believer that it is:

- one of the most useful tools humanity has invented, hailed as "the great equalizer"
- overused, overblown, and potentially limiting human thinking and flourishing

As such, because I love transparency, although it probably hasn't yet reached the point where we will value output made by humans higher than output by itself, I will explicitly state when I use AI.

As such, you have my word - as much as it is worth - that what is produced here is my own.

I ofcourse employ the use of AI - less than I should, for learning and correction.

But not for generating quick bites of beautifully cohorent but frustratingly nonsensical AI text or code.

<!-- I’m a health economist and epidemiologist with a deep interest in how data can improve the quality and value of healthcare.
My journey began in academic research, where I explored how real-world evidence and cost-effectiveness modeling can guide better decisions in chronic disease treatment. Over time, I became fascinated by the practical side — how health data are collected, structured, and transformed into insights that inform care.

Today, my focus is on bridging science and implementation: ensuring that data are reliable, meaningful, and used to strengthen patient outcomes. I believe that transparent, reproducible analysis is essential for a healthcare system that learns and improves continuously.

This site gathers projects, analyses, and reflections on how we can move from data to decisions — and from decisions to better care. -->

List of wants

- [x] testing deployment: rerendering all posts to get thumbnails right
- [x] testing deployment: test to see if i can do dark theme first, and only change about.qmd and _quarto.yml and then push changes - it should work
- [ ] tab with
  - [ ] updated CV
  - [ ] Dashboard (overview/listing of several?) - at minimum something something developments in danish medicine use or something
  - [ ] Publications
