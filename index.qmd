## Summary of wepbage

Welcome to my webpage. This can be considered by portfolio and playground. After a family-centered hiatus from working, I am picking up the torch again.

My journey from studying at university, to finishing a PhD, has lead me here. The combination of R/Quarto/Github is a wonderfully easy and customisable thing to test my skills and learn more.

**My one goal right now is figuring out how I can coalesce all my skills for the benefit of the Danish healthcare system, future colleagues, and patients.**

## Who am I

I'm a:

- Husband and father
- Data lover
- People helper
- Learner
- Explorer of connections and correlations
- Tester of theories versus the real world
- Deep thinker and systematiser
- Pragmatic solution enthusiast

## AI

As an early adopter of AI, I cannot just use AI without being highly critical of the output[^1].

[^1]: You'll know this reference if you were one too

I am a firm believer that AI is:

1. underused
   - one of the most useful tools humanity has invented, hailed as "the great equalizer"
   - most people I have worked with are just catching up to what I used it for 2 years ago
2. overused
   - prone to bubble bursting soon
   - thoughtlessly used for almost everything
   - potentially limiting human thinking and flourishing

Both points can be possible at the same time.

As such, I will explicitly state when I use AI. Transparency, and being explicit in your assumptions and intentions is something i value highly. You have my word - as much as it is worth - that what is produced here is my own.

I use AI for:

- Quick brainstorming of anything
- Learning how code works under the hood and why it works
  - This is faster and much better formulated than documentation usually is

And not for generating quick bites of beautifully cohorent but frustratingly nonsensical AI text or code.

List of wants

- [x] testing deployment: rerendering all posts to get thumbnails right
- [x] testing deployment: test to see if i can do dark theme first, and only change about.qmd and _quarto.yml and then push changes - it should work
- [ ] tab with
  - [x] updated CV
  - [x] Some Publications
  - [ ] Dashboard (overview/listing of several?) - at minimum something something developments in danish medicine use or something
