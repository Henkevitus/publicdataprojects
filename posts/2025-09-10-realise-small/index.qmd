I just realised that my blog posts have been quote non-blog like.

The purpose of this blog is to play around and show that I can do stuff with R, and that I understand how healthcare data works.

That needs to be delivered in smaller chunks than the "report-like" posts I have been putting out there.

So here is a pledge to help me getting back on track:

> I can play around with long drafts all day long, but at the end of the day, the blogpost must be a small, digestible piece of writing with a clear purpose. I don't need to prepare everything in advance and write it down meticulously, but it must be *less* massive posts so I can write more *frequent* posts.
