![Figure 3: Depicted here are the proportions of each drug class at each treatment stage for the cohort, i.e. the first to the sixth introduced drug for each individual patient, over time. Omitted bars in 2012 are due to insufficient or lacking data. MET = metformin, SU = sulfonylurea, DPP4 = dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, GLP1 = glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 = sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, TZD = thiazolidinedions, AGI = alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, INS = insulin, METandDPP4 = metformin and DPP4 combination, OTHERS = all other anti-hyperglycaemic drugs.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2025/06/21/2025.06.20.25328883/F3.large.jpg?width=800&height=600&carousel=1)
