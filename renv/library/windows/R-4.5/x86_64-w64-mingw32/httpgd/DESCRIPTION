Description: A graphics device for R that is accessible via network
        protocols. This package was created to make it easier to embed
        live R graphics in integrated development environments and
        other applications. The included 'HTML/JavaScript' client (plot
        viewer) aims to provide a better overall user experience when
        dealing with R graphics. The device asynchronously serves
        graphics via 'HTTP' and 'WebSockets'.
