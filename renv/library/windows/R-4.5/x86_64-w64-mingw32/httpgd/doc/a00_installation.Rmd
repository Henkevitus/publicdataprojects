Install `httpgd` from CRAN:

```R
install.packages("httpgd")
```

Or get the latest development version from GitHub:

```R
remotes::install_github("nx10/httpgd")
```

See [system requirements](#System-requirements) for troubleshooting.

## System requirements

Depends on `R` version &geq; 4.0 on windows, and R &geq; 3.2 on linux and macOS (a C++ compiler with basic C++17 support [is required](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd/issues/56)).

Note that there is a rare bug in R versions < 4.1, that leads to [some plots disappearing when ggplot2 plots are resized and deleted in a specific way](https://github.com/nx10/httpgd/issues/50).

Also see the [`unigd` system requirements](https://nx10.github.io/unigd/articles/a00_installation.html#system-requirements).
