`httpgd` fully supports RStudio:

## Usage

To open a client in the embedded RStudio `Viewer`-tab call `hgd_view()` after starting the server:

```R
library(httpgd)
hgd()
hgd_view()
```

To view a client in an external browser window call:

```R
# hgd()
hgd_browse()
```

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes (if the `Viewer`-tab is resized with any plot in the `Plots`-tab) RStudio will activate its own graphics device, the `Plots`-tab will obtain focus, and `httpgd` will show the message _"Device inactive."_ in the `Viewer`-tab.

The list of graphics devices (`dev.list()`) will look something like this:

```R
> dev.list()
RStudioGD   agg_png    httpgd 
        2         3         4 
```

This can be easily solved by closing the current (RStudioGD) graphics device:

```R
> dev.off()
httpgd 
     4 
```

After that `dev.list()` should only show a `httpgd` device:

```R
> dev.list()
httpgd 
     4 
```

The problem should not reappear afterwards, even after resizing the pane.
